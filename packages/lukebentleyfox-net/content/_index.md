I'm a software developer from London, interested in using functional programming, machine learning, and devops to solve complicated problems.

A lot of the time when I've finished working such a problem, usually many hours deep into the rabbit hole, I realise it would be super useful for others if I wrote up what I learnt and threw it out there like yesterday's trash. This is me finally making good on that idea.

I also like skating, brutalist architecture, and mixing music. If you have something you think I might be interested in... I probably am, so don't hesitate to share it with me!
